# FitXAI - AI-Powered Fitness Web App

##  About the Project
FitXAI is my graduation capstone project — a smart fitness web app that uses AI and a webcam to count exercise repetitions in real-time. It provides users with live feedback to track their workouts effectively and stay motivated.

##  Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Backend:** Python (Flask / Django)
- **AI Model:** Pose Estimation (e.g. Mediapipe & OpenPose)
- **Computer Vision:** OpenCV

##  Key Features
- Real-time rep counting of 4 exercices (squats, push-ups, etc.)
- Works directly from the browser using webcam
- Visual feedback on posture and form
- Responsive UI for easy usage

##  My Role
- Developed the full web application (frontend + backend)
- Integrated pose estimation for rep counting
- Designed real-time camera tracking and feedback system
